# 1.2 Target Audience

## General Profile

People who lack continuity in their interactions with AI. They want an assistant that remembers what matters from their lives and uses that context in subsequent conversations — without setup, without effort.

Not tied to a specific technical proficiency level. The key criterion is having life context that one wants to preserve and reuse.

## Personas

### 1. Socially Active Person

**Profile.** 25–40 years old, wide social circle, busy life. Many friends, events, plans — details get lost.

**Pain.** Forgets details about people and events. Before meeting a friend, can't recall what they talked about last time. Misses birthdays.

**Scenario.** "What do I know about Dima?" → the bot provides a summary: lives in Berlin, works in fintech, daughter is 2 years old, birthday March 15. "Remind me to congratulate Dima on March 15" → the bot reminds.

**Value.** The bot as social memory — helps maintain relationships.

---

### 2. Active AI User

**Profile.** Regularly interacts with AI assistants for work and personal matters. Technically literate but not necessarily a developer.

**Pain.** Every new conversation starts from scratch. Tired of re-explaining who they are, what they do, what they're working on, what their preferences are.

**Scenario.** Discusses a work project with the bot → a week later asks "how's my project going?" → the bot remembers the context and gives a relevant response.

**Value.** The bot as a continuous conversational partner — no need to start from a clean slate every time.

---

### 3. Person in Transition

**Profile.** Relocating, changing jobs, starting a new phase of life. Many decisions, a lot of new context.

**Pain.** Hard to keep all the details in mind: documents, deadlines, new acquaintances, decisions. Wants someone to "remember" alongside them.

**Scenario.** Tells the bot about relocating to a new city → the bot remembers. Later asks "recommend where to look for an apartment" → the bot takes into account that the user already mentioned a budget and neighborhood.

**Value.** The bot as a contextual companion — helps not get lost in a stream of changes.

---

### 4. Young Parent

**Profile.** Child aged 0–6. Many questions about developmental milestones, health, parenting. Information accumulates but is never systematized anywhere.

**Pain.** Remembers major milestones (started daycare) but small details slip away — when they started riding a bike, when they were fully potty-trained, how many times they were sick in a year. At the pediatrician's appointment, the doctor asks — and there's nothing to answer. Wants to consult with AI, but has to retell the entire history every time.

**Scenario.** "Son started daycare in September" → the bot remembers. "Son got sick, temperature 38°C" → the bot remembers. Six months later: "How many times has my son been sick since starting daycare?" → the bot gives an exact answer with dates.

**Value.** The bot as an intelligent child diary — remembers the history and helps make decisions based on it.

## Who Is Not the Target Audience

- Users who need a universal assistant (email, calendar, automation)
- Developers looking for an API/infrastructure for their own products
- People who want to create a "digital twin" or a legacy for descendants
